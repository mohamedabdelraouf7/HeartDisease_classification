# Heart Disease Classification

This project implements various machine learning models to classify the presence of heart disease using a dataset of clinical features. The main focus is on model development, evaluation, and feature preprocessing techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook explores the application of classification algorithms, particularly:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes

Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler), and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning are also used.

## 📁 Files

- `HeartDisease_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and model implementation.
## 🧪 Requirements

Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn fast-ml
